This repo is part of a school project at Blekinge Institute of Technology and it contains the front-end for my examination assignment in the course Ramverk2. In short, the task is to create a service / application where we use techniques that we have tested / learned in the course, we was free to choose any modern front-end technology we like, so i decided to use React.js for this project.
