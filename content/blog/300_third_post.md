The Best Online Courses To Learn Node Js
==================================

NodeJS is a platform that allows developers to write server side high performance and networked applications. And that too using good old Javascript.

Why should I learn NodeJS ? Well, for starters, learning something new never hurts. But most importantly, learning NodeJS is great because :

1. Node allows you to write highly scalable networked apps deployed on the cloud !
2. You’re working at a different level of application design per se with Node and that means that you’re not writing an app that sits on top of a stack, you design the stack from the server up. And while that may sound daunting, it really is not and you’ll see why.
3. You code in the same language, both on the server and on the front end ! We’re all polyglots (we use multiple programming languages and syntax in most of our projects), but managing code in the same language on the back-end and the front-end never hurts and in-fact can be a huge time saver when debugging.
4. NodeJS is used by the likes of LinkedIn, Yahoo and Microsoft to name a few. Its pretty new and consequently you gain advantage from the exponentially growing community of NodeJS & Javascript developers and that’s great fun, really !
5. If you’ve been coding in Javascript, you can leverage your existing knowledge and skills and take it to a whole new level !

### 1. Learn and Understand NodeJS

Dive deep under the hood of NodeJS. Learn V8, Express, the MEAN stack, core Javascript concepts, and more.

In this course you will gain a deep understanding of Node, learn how NodeJS works under the hood, and how that knowledge helps you avoid common pitfalls and drastically improve your ability to debug problems.

In this course we’ll look at how the C++ written V8 Javascript engine works and how NodeJS uses it to expand the abilities of Javascript. You’ll learn how to structure your code for reuse and to be easier to understand, manage, and expand using modules and understand how modules really work.

You’ll learn how asynchronous code works in Node and the Node event loop, as well as how to use the event emitter, streams, buffers, pipes, and work with files. We’ll see how that leads to building a web server in Node.

You’ll dive into web sites, web apps and APIs with Express and learn how Express can save us time as Node developers.

### 2. All about Node.JS

Create & Deploy High Performance NodeJS Apps on the Cloud and More.

In this course, we’ll go from absolute scratch, all the way up to building and deploying full blown NodeJS app on the Cloud.

With NodeJS, you will build two full blown apps. You will go all the from concept creation, UI/UX design to coding and deploying our app on the cloud.

A. ChatCAT — One of the fun things that you can do with NodeJS is build realtime apps that allow a high number of concurrent users to interact with each other. Examples of this kind include Chat Servers, Gaming Servers, Collaborative Tools etc. You will build a multi-room chat server that allows users to login via Facebook, Create Chatrooms of their choice and Chat in realtime.You will not only create this app, but also deploy it on Heroku and Digital Ocean.

You will learn all about using Websockets, Structuring your App in an efficient manner, creating and using development & production configurations, Authentication using Facebook, Setting up an App on Facebook, Managing Sessions, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Heroku & Digital Ocean’s Cloud Services and lots more…

B. PhotoGRID — The second complete app that we will build in this course is a Photo Gallery app which lets users upload images into a gallery with the ability to vote up the images that they like. This NodeJS app lets users upload files, which are then resized to thumbnails on the server and stored in an Amazon S3 Bucket for optimal delivery to the front end interface. The entire app runs on an Amazon EC2 Cloud Server which we will create from scratch and configure for use.

You will learn about managing file uploads using NodeJS & AJAX, Resizing Images on the Server, Accessing & Storing files in an S3 Bucket, Querying & Using a Hosted MongoDB Database, Using Amazon’s Elastic IP Service & Cloudfront distribution, ensuring your NodeJS app runs automatically even if the server is restarted and lots more.
