SEO (search engine optimisation) was, and still can be, a bit like this and if you try to force Google’s hand where it is ranking sites organically, based on ‘merit’, Google DOES have a big surprise in store for you.

In short, there are low-risk longer-term benefits to be had with some strategies in 2018, and high-risk shorter-term benefits to be had with others.

If you run a reputable business and RELY on your website to run that business, you had probably better avoid relying on low-quality techniques to promote it to the top of Google.

###There Are Rules When It Comes To Ranking in Search Engines

The terms and conditions Google lay down in their webmaster guidelines documents clearly indicate that if you try to manipulate your rankings in ways Google disapproves of they will penalise your site or worse, remove it entirely from its ‘index of the web’ (and sometimes for a long time).

Google disapproves of a LOT of, if not MOST old SEO tactics in 2018 and comes down hard when it detects ‘deceptive’ practices.

Making a claim for a top spot IN A COMPETITIVE industry without quality links and relevant content over a PERIOD OF SUFFICIENT TIME,  in a vertical with relatively stable rankings, can raise a red flag to Google, or your competitors. Neither is good.

I’ve seen sites promoted using ‘lower quality’ techniques rise and rise and rise and when they get to the top, they get slapped back 40+ places. Sometimes immediately – sometimes a few months later. Sometimes they get delisted, sometimes they get a manual action.

If you are at the top of competitive results you can bet Google will take a closer look at your site.

That might mean a deeper algorithmic analysis of your site or even a manual review. Google has tens of thousands of manual reviewers who rate the quality of their results pages, and the sites that feature in them.

Even today, I am cautious about all of a sudden appearing near the top of results, especially with a lower quality page.

Sometimes, it is shortly followed by a big drop, if the methods used were a little ropey.
